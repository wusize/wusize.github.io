I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student at the [School of Computer Science and Engineering](http://scse.ntu.edu.sg/Pages/Home.aspx), Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. I am a member of [MMLab@NTU](https://www.mmlab-ntu.com/), affiliated with the NTU S-Lab, supervised by Professor [Chen Change (Cavan) Loy](http://personal.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/~ccloy/). My resume is [here](/files/wusize_cv_2025v1.pdf). Before my Ph.D. study, I obtained my B.Eng. degree in Electronic Information Engineering from University of Science and Technology of China (USTC).

My current research focus is on multimodal understanding and generation. My prior research focuses were on open-vocabulary visual recognition, visual foundation models and multi-view human pose estimation. I work closely with [Wenwei Zhang](http://zhangwenwei.cn/), [Sheng Jin](https://jin-s13.github.io/) and [Lumin Xu](https://github.com/luminxu).
